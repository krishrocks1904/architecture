# Things to Estimate

- You can't estimate any system without any sort of a breakdown. Below you will find the breakdown I typically use.

## Building Blocks

First step is to identify the building blocks the solution will consist of from a high level. There are different techniques to do that:

Event Storming
Action/Actor approach
Workflow approach

Now you need to estimate is the effort to be actually sure the system will fulfill the requirements correctly. Typical questions are:

- How much of automation testing we will use?
- Do we need contract testing?
- What tools will be used for the performance testing?
- How do we test on security?
- How do we measure availability(nines)?
