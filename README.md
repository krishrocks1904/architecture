# Architecture

# Project estimation

What is the business requirement?

What is the value proposition for the custom software?

## Functional requirements

  - What are the usecase scenarios?
    - architects do not create those scenarios: we expect them to be ready from the product owners and UX designers.
    - help to understand the personas the system will interact with, their needs and objectives.
  - 
## Non-Functional requirements

  -  Those requirements describe not what the system should do, rather how it should do it
      -  How fast? 
      -  How many users should be supported? 
      -  What security standards should be applied?
      -  They might have an idea about the amount of users they would like to target.
      -  Part of those requirements will explicitly reside right in the initial request, i.e. a target number of users. Others will come from the domain knowledge.

## Constraints



# Assumptions

  - The list of requirements will be not complete. Never. Accept it.
  - Some requirements you will not be able to gather, some of them customer will not be thinking of for now. Sometimes there will be no opportunity to ask a proper question(believe me, I saw it happened many times).
  - Assumptions come to help. You will be doing them implicitly anyway, so writing them down explicitly helps to communicate the solution and estimation inside your group and to the customer.
