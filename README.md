# Project estimation

What is the business requirement?

What is the value proposition for the custom software?

## Functional requirements

  - What are the usecase scenarios?
    - architects do not create those scenarios: we expect them to be ready from the product owners and UX designers.
    - help to understand the personas the system will interact with, their needs and objectives.
  - 
## Non-Functional requirements

  -  Those requirements describe not what the system should do, rather how it should do it
      -  How fast? 
      -  How many users should be supported? 
      -  What security standards should be applied?
      -  They might have an idea about the amount of users they would like to target.
      -  Part of those requirements will explicitly reside right in the initial request, i.e. a target number of users. Others will come from the domain knowledge.

## Constraints



# Assumptions

  - The list of requirements will be not complete. Never. Accept it.
  - Some requirements you will not be able to gather, some of them customer will not be thinking of for now. Sometimes there will be no opportunity to ask a proper question(believe me, I saw it happened many times).
  - Assumptions come to help. You will be doing them implicitly anyway, so writing them down explicitly helps to communicate the solution and estimation inside your group and to the customer.

## Estimation Timeline & Output Format
    - You can spend on estimations couple of days. You may also spend a whole month for it. But if you spend a month, and the estimation was required two days after the request, you wasted your time and achieved nothing. It is highly important to know when the result is expected and what format will be convenient.
    you need to know the estimation timeline and what format its expected in.
    
 # Estimation Team
## Platform Experts
Your system is likely to include some web apps, backend services, mobile apps and so on. Don't try to estimate everything on your own: bring the specialists. Delegate.

## Fellow Architects
 - The architects do also have their specialties as well. System architects, Data Architects are examples coming to my mind. You might want to ask their advise as well. Also, having another couple of eyes reviewing your system design always help to check if anything is missed.
